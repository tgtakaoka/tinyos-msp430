/***************************************************************************
 *
 * Perform basic initilization of the clock subsystem on a msp430 (x1, 1611,
 * basic_clock) or msp430X (x2, 26xx, basic_clock+, bc2).  The clock systems
 * on the x1 and x2 devices are similar enough to be supported by the same
 * driver.  x5 devices use a different system, the Unified Clock System.
 *
 * TinyOS assumes a 1 uis (us) ticker and a 32 KiHZ (30.5 us) ticker.  The
 * later is used for timing when sleeping.  On the x1 and x2 processors, the
 * 1 uis ticker (micro) is implemented by TimerA and the 32 KiHZ ticker is
 * on TimerB.
 *
 * The basic_clock system provides a main clock (DCO) used to clock the
 * CPU (MCLK).  Peripherals (timers, usci, uart, spi, i2c, etc)
 * are driven off SMCLK (sub-main), driven off DCO via a divider network.
 * TimerA is clocked off SMCLK and needs to be set to provide a 1uis (1us)
 * ticker.
 *
 * The include file Msp430DcoSpec.h determines how the clock system should
 * be set up.   Selectors in this file determine the configuration.
 *
 * TARGET_DCO_HZ: Base DCO frequency.
 * SMCLK_DIV:	  SMCLK divider.   SMCLK = DCO/(SMCLK_DIV).
 * TIMERA_DIV:	  determines the SMCLK divider for TimerA.
 *
 * Default settings:
 *
 * CPU clock: DCO 4MiHZ, (MCLK = DCO/1)
 * SMCLK:     DCO/4 (1MiHZ).
 * TimerA:    1uis (1MiHZ), SMCLK/1
 * Default Bauds: based on SMCLK 1MiHZ.
 *
 * 4 MiHZ is chosen for low power reasons.  Other processors support higher
 * speeds but defaulting to 4 MiHZ simplifies a number of things.
 *
 * The x1 processors are spec'd by TI as having a max speed of 8MHz.  TinyOS
 * is spec'd as using binary time (see TEP102).  So the simplest set up is
 * to set the x1 clock to 4 MiHZ (4194304 HZ) while 8 MiHZ (8388608) exceeds
 * the maximum clock speed as spec'd by TI.   Not a good idea.
 *
 * x2 processors can be clocked up to 16 MHZ, so running at 8 MiHZ would work.
 * A default of 4 MiHZ is chosen for lower power and to have a single main
 * clock speed.
 *
 * We also want to have a single set of baud rates as the default.   This
 * requires having a default SMCLK frequency.   We default to 1 MiHZ.
 *
 * ACLK (Aux Clk) is assumed to be run off the LFXT interface (low-freq) at
 * 32KiHz (32768).  This clock is used to calibrate the main DCO clock and
 * serves as the timer source for TB, the long term timer when sleeping.
 *
 * MCLK (Main Clk) is run off the DCO and is calibrated to 32KiHz (32768)
 * crystal (ACLK).  DCO/1.
 *
 * SMCLK (sub-main clock) is run directly off the DCO (FREQ).  DCO/(SMCLK_DIV).
 * All peripherals are run off the SMCLK.  The default should be 1MiHZ.  Default
 * baud rate setting are provided assuming this 1 MiHZ SMCLK setting.
 *
 * TimerA is programmed for a 1uis tick and is SMCLK/(TIMERA_DIV).  TIMERA_DIV can
 * be a maximum of 8 on x1 or x2 procs.  If MCLK is clocked faster than 8 MiHz
 * either SMCLK can become DCO/2 (which slows the peripherals down) or the timer
 * subsystem is changed to deal with a 512ns tick.
 *
 * TimerB is run off the 32KiHz crystal oscillator.  This is used to provide
 * a stable time base for syncronizing the main DCO clock.  It also provides
 * a stable timer that runs the timer system especially when the cpu is
 * sleeping.
 *
 * XT2 isn't used for an external oscillator because it is expensive and a power
 * hog.  It also takes a long time (measured ~5ms) to power up and stabilize.
 * You don't want to be doing that if one is putting the cpu to sleep a bunch
 * (which is needed for low power).
 *
 * WARNING: This module assumes that the 32KiHz XTAL has stablized.  This
 * is assumed to have been performed in Platform Initilization.
 *
 * The Platform code gets executed on the way up and so certain assumptions can
 * be made about the state of clocking system.  Otherwise we have to put the
 * clocks into a known state and stabilize the 32KiHz.   Once done we can just
 * proceed here with calibration of the main DCO.
 *
 * We may want to revisit this later and move wait_for_32K into this module but
 * it needs to be thought through better and what the ramifications are.  Placing
 * wait_for_32k into the startup code in Platform is safe.   It just has the
 * downside of having to put into each different platform startup when new platforms
 * are added.

   * Controls for the algorithm behaviour are:
   *

   *	TARGET_DCO_HZ		target dco frequency

   * control cell is the concatenation of RSEL (3/4 bits), DCOx (3 bits), and

   *
